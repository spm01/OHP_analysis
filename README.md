A brief analysis of the Oregon Health Plan's natural experiment.

This project involved the Oregon Health Plan's natural experiment that occurred via randomization into a newly available healthcare plan sponsored by Oregon and Medicaid. 

The participants were completely randomized for assignment into treatment and control, lending room to high external validity. 

If anyone has any suggestions about my coding, process, or conclusions, feel free to drop me a line!
